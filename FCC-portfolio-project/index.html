      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>A (wannabe) web developer with proficiency in Javascript, competence in HTML5 and CSS3, and an eagerness to learn just about anything. I have experience creating things from scratch (websites, javascript applications, major messes, handknit socks... the works) and debugging (I'm great at figuring out problems with scope and closure... but also not too shabby when I'm up against stinkbugs and spiders), and I'm committed to producing high-quality work (and am learning to use testing to ensure good results)!</p>
      <p>No, I'm not quite job-ready yet... but I'd love to hear from you anyway! Ten minutes for an informational interview will allow <em>YOU</em> to shape the (awesome) web-developer I will become!</p>

      <h2>Portfolio Projects</h2>
      <section class="project">
        <img src="" alt="">
        <div>
          <h3>Project Name</h3>
          <p>Here's where I'll describe the project, give a summary of what skills this project demonstrates, what I've learned, or other information that presumptive portfolio-readers might want to know.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="project">
        <img src="" alt="">
        <div>
          <h3>Another Project Name</h3>
          <p>And here I'll say that this project is supposed to do XYZ thing, and that I implemented it using ZYX tools (demonstrating that I know those tools exist and have at least some idea of how they're used), and possibly say a couple of others things that make it sound like I know what I'm doing... even though I probably don't.</p>

      <section class="project">
        <img src="" alt="">
        <div>
          <h3>Okay, this is the last one</h3>
          <p>By "one", I obviously mean placeholder project. Basically right now my main concern is layout, and it'll be easier to see any issues with layout if I have at least three placeholder projects - which means at least 4 actual projects, because I guess the portfolio actually counts as one. Although, really... I'm tempted to say that I don't want anyone to actually read it... but I'm also posting this on the internet, and it will exist there forever. What a waste of memory on someone else's computer... Good thing I can delete it from mine!</p>

    <section id="contact" class="page">
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>Got something to say? I'd love to hear from you. This form doesn't actually do anything... but we can pretend, at least. Go ahead, fill it out anyway. I'll never know the difference.</p>
      <form method="post">
