      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>A (wannabe) web developer with proficiency in Javascript, competence in HTML5 and CSS3, and an eagerness to learn just about anything. I have experience creating things from scratch (websites, javascript applications, major messes, handknit socks... the works) and debugging (I'm great at figuring out problems with scope and closure... but also not too shabby at cockroaches and spiders), and I'm committed to producing high-quality results (and <em>will</em> use testing to ensure good results)!</p>
      <p>No, I'm not quite job-ready yet... but I'd love to hear from you anyway! Ten minutes for an informational interview will allow <em>YOU</em> to shape the (awesome) web-developer I will become!</p>
